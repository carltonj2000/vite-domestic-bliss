          The 3rd pitch on this route is classic! The rest is just...there.
          <ul>
            <li>
              P1. We racked up before seeing the squeeze. Had to stem up the
              outside, and then scramble across the chockstone bridge.
            </li>
            <li>P2. Stop 20' short of the chimney to belay.</li>
            <li>P3. As stated: Go LEFT via hand traverse at the roof.</li>
            <li>
              P4. We stayed left in the corner, felt hard. Should have used the
              cracked face on the right.
            </li>
            <li>P5. Fun on good rock, but basically 5.0 scrambling.</li>
          </ul>
          Rack beta is good. Doubles .5-2 and singles in the rest.

          3rd pitch is great as noted above. Harder than most 5.8s (and many
          5.9s) I've done in RR so probably not a good option if pushing your
          grade. I ran P1\P2 together and likely stopped too early so I ended up
          running out of the useful gear sizes 3/4 of the way up P3 (with a
          double rack) and ended up setting a belay on a small ledges to the
          left of the P3 corner about 20 feet below the traverse. This worked
          great but the belay there takes very small gear (I used 0.1 and 0.2
          X4, nuts would work as well). Just something to keep in mind.

          P3 is the real deal, and an excellent pitch. A tricky move or two gets
          you off the belay ledge, then a fairly casual 5.6 section gets you
          into the stem box. The box starts out reasonable and fun, but then
          turns slightly left where the stems either get super thin and
          worrisome, or you go into chimney mode. A few layback holds aid your
          entry into the chimney, and the protection is good. The crux comes as
          you come up to a roof and swing right to the base of the right-facing
          crack. The swing move isn't too bad, with a great jug for hands and a
          solid foot divot to access. The crux is the next move or two that gets
          you started into the crack. We found this to be at least 5.9 (my
          partner commented that there are 10a's trickier than this). Luckily
          this all protects rather well. The crack above is intimidating but
          goes at 5.8 / 5.9 (thin hands, 1" cams) until it thins down to a
          miniscule seam with no protection. Step left before getting to this
          section. You'll climb a heady 5.6 section (good rock, no pro) on /
          near the arete straight up to where you can place more gear below the
          roof. You will then traverse straight left for about 4 moves on the
          face below the roof to a stance. This could be the spiciest section of
          the pitch, as the hands are good but the feet are fragile. Some gear
          could be placed to protect this traverse, but it won't feel quite
          bomber. This pitch is a terrific semi-epic on its own if you are a
          5.8/9 leader, and it is well worth the approach to experience it.
